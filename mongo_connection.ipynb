I have not tested them on skating street, or transition, but,  they are great for cruising on an electric board. They‚Äôre very comfortable and sturdy. I definitely recommend these especially if you are a fan of Adidas.', 'This is my second pair of Adidas Daily sneakers. I love them! They look amazing and are very comfortable. They‚Äôre also not expensive either, which I appreciate. Adidas did a great job with these, as they usually do with their skate sneakers.My only complaint is that the insert that covers the shoe sole is thin and eventually gets a bit uncomfortable. I can actually feel and see the crosscut pattern of the sole in the liner. I‚Äôve purchased gel sole inserts for both pairs of Daily sneakers I have, but this is something Adidas should consider making an adjustment to going forward.', 'Tard√≥ un poco en llegar pero el art√≠culo cumple con lo especificado y esta todo correcto, gracias', \"Let me start by saying, I love the style of this shoe!  I got the Core Black/Cloud White/Core Black, and it looks great!  They call the color black, but it's really like a graphite gray.  Nice.Anyway, the shoe is fairly comfortable to wear.  I do have shoes that are more comfortable, but they also cost more than these.  I can get these shoes to slip on and off without untying them and they match pretty much everything.My one small complaint with these shoes is that there is a bit of material that keeps sort of curling upwards and not lying flat.  It's the small strip of material that they lace grommets are set in.  At the toe end of the material, it is cut into a bit of a point - maybe with like a 60‚Äì70 degree angle.  That's where it sticks up a little.  The material doesn't stick up far and so maybe I'm just being a bit nitpicky, but it does bother some.  But overall, if I can ignore that, these are great shoes.  I'm still very happy to have bought them.\", 'So comfortable. Exactly what I was looking for.', \"Comfy and true to size. I love the old school looks. Got the men's style cause I like it better.\", 'Like the lookThey fitDecent priceCase closed', \"I was skeptical because some reviews of skate shoes are that they are cheaply made, but these seem to be pretty nice. Ive only worn them a few times but walked in them for a hour. The styling and canvas are really nice. I'm sure a skate shoe won't feel good after long hours but for walking around they are good. I wanted something that looked good and was not a basketball or reg sneaker look. And I love Addidas.Last shoe I bought from them was their Cloud series sneaker, and those are really comfy.\", 'I love these things.  Very comfortable and durable.  I have walked hundreds of miles in them and they still look and feel great.  No wear shown other than the bottoms of the shoe starting to wear, but way less than most shoes at this age.', \"I love the way these looks but wearing them is a chore.

The 2.0s were the same color, but the stripes were black, so they didn't stick out as much.  I liked that better.  My biggest complaint about the 3.0s is the black line around the sole.

I bought the Daily 2.0s 3 years ago and was like \"I will buy the new ones\" I did and prefer my old ones. Because they changed the soul and the new soul is magnitudes worse. The old ones I had came with \"cloudfoam\" Souls. I work in a warehouse 11-12 hours a day and they were super comfy. More so than any other show I have worn. They changed this soul out for the current \"Ortholite\" souls. They suck in comparison. I am looking at both next to each other right now. Id say the old version is about 4x thicker. And that foam has a nicer cloth topping. And these are over 3 years old so probably were better when bought. I also used the same shoes from 6ish years ago, Those are not as great as cloud foam, but still better than Ortholite. Thay are in the middle in thickness between the 2. But the cloud clearly feels more responsive and better with again the best topping.So my suggestion is to find and buy the cloud foam version of these made years ago off of eBay if you want these.

Typically the 2.0.Due to flat, narrow feet and overpronation, I use custom orthotics with them as well.  This can make the shoes a bit snug with thicker athletic socks.  Not a bother because I like a tight shoe that doesn't make me feel like I'm sliding around in them.  Laces run a bit short in my setup, tho.I usually buy the black with white stripes but opted for the solid black this time.

Well worth the purchase price!', 'The sneakers are very nice.', \"I'm a 50+ year old dad that is hopefully not trying too hard to look somewhat cool. Actually, just writing that last sentence shows I'm not. But I have a younger son and these sneakers allow me to BMX with him and occasionally ride his skateboard in style.

Feel like they'll last a long time.\", 'Love the design and color. Durable, except for the bottom wears pretty quickly.', 'Second pair I have purchased, love how the Adidas strips go through and is visible through the bottom of the shoe.', 'I normally wear a 10 1/2, but that felt too tight.

Obvious signs of previous cleaning. Obvious wear on the lace holes (new shoes are also never laced out of the box). The box was damaged and held together with a different product's tape. The shoes did not have the expected paper inside. The attached tag also was not standard and appeard forged and added after the fact.\", 'Comparing these to my Adidas Busenitz that I got at the same time.
