      "  'Reviews': [\"I ordered this laptop to replace mine after it was stolen. To be honest, This early 2015 model style is my favorite because it is the last time Apple left the assortment of attachments on their laptop. Having access to two USB 3 connections, HDMI, SD, and two thunderbolt connections are really handy for connectivity and losing them to get a newer model didn't seem like something I wanted to do.Having read the description and the reviews, some of which were claiming that this really was an Apple refurbished product I decided to take a chance. With my previous knowledge of the product, I was extremely disappointed in many things.1. Upon receiving the product there was no documentation included in the slightly damaged box. To ship the computer a white, unmarked cardboard box was lightly padded with bubble wrap and a thin sheet of white foam for protection. This box had been placed in a plastic shipping bag. I fell there was quite a good chance that in transit this computer could easily have been damaged.2. When I opened the box I realized there was no documentation. This lack of printed material inside only raised my speculation as to the shotty workmanship that may have gone into the renewal of the product. Without paperwork showing who did the work and whom to contact if there were issues, it seemed as if those who had done the work were not exactly pleased with their own workmanship.3. Although the laptop was clean it was not in a separate plastic bag to ensure it would not get scratched during shipment. The computer was merely placed among the packing material inside the box.4. Looking at the overall appearance of the laptop it seemed appropriate though it seemed as if the fine finishing Apple does to the outer metal shell was not correct. The edges are always crisp and smooth where there appeared to be rougher. I also noted, as visible in the image provided, that there was no tag on the bottom. Apple places a tag on the bottom of their cases with information including the model number. This number is used by several third-party companies that provide aftermarket items such as cases for their products. It also authenticates the product as being a genuine Apple product. With this missing, I feel there is an excellent chance that the bottom case had to be replaced in the refurbishing process leaving me to believe that hardware on the inside might have needed to be replaced.5. Once I turned the computer on I noticed some other details. The first is that whoever had set up the interface assumed you were using Xfinity as an internet provider. I was also extremely disappointed in this interface because of how generic it was, again not giving away any details as to who had done the renewal and giving rise to even more suspicion as to the quality of the product I had received.6; Having previously had the exact same model previously for several years I can attest that it is slightly slower than the one I had previously, the internet, as well as applications, do not respond with the same robustness as I would expect.So, this all boils down to, a consumer, I should have been more careful. I should have read the return policy more carefully noting that it did not have the normal 30-day return policy and that there would most certainly be a restocking fee if sent back. I should have thought through the fact that the renewal process may result in the cheapening of the quality generally associated with Apple products and that the parts used to restore the laptop to its original condition may not be on par with what Apple originally used.  I the future I will only buy Apple Certified Refurbished computers and not trust Amazon Renewed products to be up to snuff.\",\n",
      "   'Understanding the operating system good value',\n",
      "   'I am always a bit wary of buying a used computer. This is my first time buying through Amazon refurbished.  The laptop arrived quickly and I was impressed by the contents in that they were true to advertise and so far the laptop works just fine. I was disappointed in the products casing though. It was very scratched up and even had a few strange patches of what felt like bubbling or rusted material. It worries me that if the laptops skin is that scratched up that there may have been quite a bit of physical abuse to the product originally. It’s too early to see how that will affect my use, but with this said I think it should’ve been priced a little bit lower. If nothing else for peace of mind.',\n",

I am very pleased with this and would definitely purchase another should the need arise.',\n",
      "   'Well, I thought I was happy with this purchase. I migrated my old computer over and, though it wasn\\'t perfect, I was thinking I maybe just needed to reconfigure a few things to make it right. Then I installed a new bit of software that requires Monterey, the latest OS. This computer, being an early 2015 Macbook Pro, should be able to update to Monterey with no issues.  However, I kept getting a response that firmware couldn\\'t be installed  because \"compatible internal storage is required to update.\" Got on the phone with Apple, and sure enough, this hard drive is not compatible. Catalina is as far as it can go. I upgraded to this specifically because it\\'s newer than my 2012, but come to find out it can\\'t go any further up the chain than the 2012 could.

It is a small negative, but for the price of this product, and the expectation that you are getting a premium product, it is a disappointment.

      "   'I had windows before and now I have a Mac. This is a great purchase. The laptop made a big impression on me.The delivery: I was supposed to sign for it upon delivery and I never did. It was dropped off on my front doorstep. She caught me doing something with my hands full and wet, and I assume she had to be going to her next delivery to stay on schedule. Back to the Mac review.The M2 Air: What can I tell you? This thing is really small. Upon taking it out of its packaging, I held it in my hands and it felt like I was holding a composition notebook, but a tad bit lighter. It does not feel like holding an envelope like it was revealed back in the first Mac Air laptop. It was like holding a windows surface laptop, except lighter. The laptop turned on on its own and I set up everything in less than half an hour. I may miss right clicking with my old windows laptop, but holding down the scrolling pad is way easier on this thing. I learned the basics, the advanced internet tips and tricks, and the essentials in less than ten minutes. I picked up on everything in less than an hour. It took me longer to choose a password than anything else. Lol. But, it was simple. It runs really smooth and I hear nothing. It’s so silent, I tapped on the mute button and it does not give out one sound from the internal system. It’s easily the best laptop out right now.The one con I have: There are none aside from the fact that the typing on the keyboardis about the only noise you’ll pick up. Yes, the keyboard fret buttons sound plastic and rub on them and it sounds like an eerie screeching noise. In all retrospect, I’m not about to rub the keyboard. That’s not what it’s for.Video / Audio: I watched on Apple TV. The sound became better to my ears switching from watching an HD movie to a 4K movie. I watched The Blair Witch Project, the old film from 1999, then I put on the new Blair Witch movie that resolutes a picture of 4K and let me say that the audio on 4K sounds crispier than HD movies. I could hear the footsteps and environmental noises for full immersion. It was like I was in the movie. I watched it at night while everybody’s asleep. That movie scares the crap out of me. The picture was HD. The brightness was low. The sound was past halfway. It looked okay because Blair Witch Project has the female character video recording on an old camera. It looks like it looked the first time I watched The Blair Witch Project back in the year 2000. And I like that.Multi-tasking / browsing / usageSome sites like Yahoo take a while to catch up on uploading the page as I scroll further on some articles. I also encountered ads. I’ll have to use an ad-blocker. Battery life. The Mac was on for two hours and it dropped ten percent. All I did was setup and browsing. Then, I charged it by MagSafe charger. It took about less than 15 minutes to charge all the way up to 100% from 50% on first usage.Life expectancy: The 8gb ram should run well for the next 6 to 8 years. By then you and I or whoever chose this laptop will have upgraded in the next 5 years as technology further improves.And to size up my last thoughts… Oh yes, I used the box / case it came on as a laptop case to keep it stored at night so it won’t get dusty overnight. Simple as that. Put it back in its box. It’s brand new. You wouldn’t want to have a dirty starlight. Overall, if you have had an Apple device like a smartphone, tablet, or iPod touch back then, you’ll pick up on everything on your first go. Thanks for the read through on my review and to Amazon for this amazing machine. Farewell.',\n",
      "   'I must first confess that I am an Apple fan. But that has not always been true. For years I was a Microsoft Bigot and had a windows based computer since the beginning. I switched in 2010 to Apple after a systems engineer explained the differences in architecture and the pros and cons of a closed architecture (Apple) vs an open architecture(Microsoft Windows). I obviously chose Apple and glad I did. Now yo this laptop.Fast- super fast with long battery life. Though it has a bigger screen size the laptop is actually smaller than the 2014 13” MacBook Air that it replaced! You can’t go wrong with this laptop!',\n",

      "   'I purchased this base model Macbook Air M2 for attending online courses through a university. I\\'ve been mainly a Windows PC user for a while now. My last Macbook was an old 12-inch Macbook Pro G4 (remember those mini-me/Yow Ming commercials?).After being able to use this laptop for a couple of months, I\\'ve decided that given the current state of technology within my home, my future personal computers will most likely be all Apple, as long as I continue to use iPhones, AppleTVs and Apple Accessories (such as AirPods). The current form of the MacOS allows easy use of printers/scanners and any other computer peripheral you may need.With all that said, I will say that you should consider this base model for the following reasons:- You currently have an Apple ecosystem.- You need a lightweight, small form-factor laptop for basic computing needs.- You primarily run cloud-based platforms that don\\'t require local storage.- You\\'d like to work \"unplugged\" for many hours without having to charge the laptop.- You enjoy a bright monitor and a pretty decent keyboard to type on.At the same time, I would NOT recommend this model if you need the following:- You\\'ll be running large programs that require a lot of local storage.- You require a machine that will process/render high-resolution media. The lack of a fan will cause the Macbook to thermal throttle, lowering your performance. For a little more, you\\'re better off going with the base model Macbook Pro.- Gaming (Thermal throttle will lower framerates).A few honorable mentions:- Despite the lack of larger, more visible speakers, the sound is decent for this category of laptop.- The low power requirements make this an easy travel laptop, not requiring that you bring a huge brick to keep this thing going.- The redesigned look is a lot nicer than the previous generation (I\\'m glad the wedge design is gone).Finally, regarding value:Considering where we are in tech today, I feel that for the money, we should no longer have base models with only 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD space. At the very least, I really hope that Apple would consider making their base models start at 16GB of Ram and 512GB of SSD storage without increasing the price. At the very least, if they keep the 256GB of SSD, give the option to keep an SD card on board without having to attach an external drive every time you want expanded storage.',\n",

But the main problem is the time life of Apple products in general. I have an older Dell notebook in my office and it has no problems with recent Windows version. Apple doesn't support their products more than seven or eight years. It's impossible or very expansive to replace battery or to fix keyboard.In the end of the day, the initial low investment will increase because you must replace your Mac sooner than other Windows equipment.I'm considering to give up from Apple after this M2.

After realizing what I wanted to do with the computer, this become a non-factor. I mostly do school (computer science) a little bit of rendering for my 3d printer and some very light gaming. The SSD has never been an issue in my day to day. If you are editing photos or access large files that will need to be read or written to often, maybe go to the 512GB model to get the faster SSD. If you are not working in CAD or video/photo editing all the time you will not care I promise. The rest of this machine has astounded me. 18 hours of battery life is not just marketing, the speed of the M2 is snappy and can handle much more than I thought it would. The new screen is gorgeous. Trackpad is the best on the market bar none. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever felt on a laptop and is an absolute joy to type on. MagSafe is back and amazing as before. Probably my favorite thing about this laptop, coming from a Windows gaming laptop is the lack of a fan. You will lose a little performance, but not having that noise is absolutely astounding.

But, they delivered this one without requiring my signature or anything, they just put the box in front of the door.The laptop came in a big box and it was just sort of loose in there with a generic charger. I turned the laptop on and the battery was at about 70-80% charged. The laptop so far, works well. I installed all my work programs on it and everything runs well. Then the battery was running low, so I plugged it in. The computer continued to work but it stated \"Battery not charging\". I tried shutting it down and turning it back on...nothing. Then I tried a different USB-C cable that I have that connects to a USB outlet and it finally charged but super slowly. I checked the charger and it\\'s 85W. The MacBook Air uses a 30W. It shouldn\\'t really impact charging of the battery with a higher powered charger so I\\'m confused why it\\'s not charging. I tried a few different outlets and it works in some outlets but not all. I wrote the seller and they said they\\'d forward my concern to the proper department. We shall see. I can\\'t comment too much on battery life yet since I just finally got it fully charged but I felt that it drained pretty quickly from 70% to almost 0% but I was also installing and running a bunch of programs.From the outward appearance, the MacBook Air is in great condition. I was a bit nervous from reading some reviews where there was significant damage. This one has one little scratch on one of the sides but that\\'s it. display, keyboard and trackpad are in excellent condition and looks like new.If we get the charger situation resolved then it was definitely a good purchase and I\\'d recommend it as you can save a few hundred dollars by buying a \"renewed\" computer.Just updating my review. I took the computer to the apple store and it was determined that the charger was not working properly. So, I purchased an apple charger. The seller has given me a partial refund for about half the coast of the charger, which is fine.

      "  'Reviews': ['Hello Amazon fans, I’m a technical user and I try to spend my money as best as i can and i think most of us do. My review is going to be very honest and it’s just my very personal opinion. I hope this helps you making you next purchase:I came across this macbook air and i decided to give it a go. I’m really happy with it and im gonna give it a 4 star review based on something in the listing description, so no sentiment of anger or regret is involved.when you look at the section that says what should i expect from an amazon renewed it reads as follows for “Excellent condition”Excellent condition- Cosmetic condition: Excellent (Screen: no scratches. Body: no signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 12 inches away).- Functional condition: Fully Functional (exceeds 80% of original battery life, generic or OEM accessories and packaging provided).Ok, based on it to keep it shot is: Everything complies except the dents, scratches, etc in the body when held 12 inches away. My pc has just 4 of them, 2 are small, 1 is tiny and 1 is very noticeable. (yes, i see them all further than 12 inches away)however i’m very happy with the product for multiple reasons: the product came with the original charger and cable, the screen is flawless, it has 110 battery cycles only with a battery life of 94%, the product is in awesome shape,it was well packeged, it doesnt heat up, it runs fast, IM HELPING THE PLANET and come on, we all know aluminum dents and scratches just by staring at it… so why would i feel bad from buying it?again if i stick directly to the description, this item to me was not excellent, it would be not good, it would be something in between. It was a fair price, fast shipping and it came with the M1 cpu as described in the listing. Mine came from kanga supply and i recommend buying from them, i hope this is helpful to you and remember: YOU CAN HELP THE PLANET, still get something working really well while at the same time SAVING SOME CASH… so give it a shot, its a great laptop and it syncs beautiful with your phone if you have an iphone + the screen ress and colours are stunning, a dream of a display and the keyboard feels amazing.God bless you all, good night😊',\n",
      "   'I bought this macbook in order to replace mi windows laptop. I had been a hardcore windows user for the last 15 years, but with more of the usage in my personal laptop moving away from doing technical work and excel, to more of managing email and doing creative stuff I started dreading some of the windows instability.The laptop I received had 66 cycles in its battery and had one minor but noticeable scuff in the screen lid. I bought the \"very good\" version so this was to be expected. For the price I paid (650+tax) I think it is a great deal, this laptop will last me many years and will work smoothly for all my needs.',\n",

      "   \"When I first got this MacBook, there were scratches on the laptop, but those scratches (major and minor) didn't bother me. The performance was good for first few weeks, but the laptop started running slow after few weeks. In July, I started my summer school and had to do some light python coding on google collab and the code ran very slow, and often stopped responding. I also tried to use Jupyter for coding and the software would work very slowly. Recently, one of two USB charging ports also stopped working.With all these complications, I wasn't satisfied with this MacBook and tried to return it and get a replacement. The seller told me they can't replace the laptop which was a violation of Amazon 90 days replace, return or refund warranty. I tried to return it and the return code they gave me was not valid. The employee at the Amazon locker hub told me to cancel the return and reprocess the return to get new return code. I told her that this laptop is outside the return window and I wasn't sure if I cancel the return, they would reprocess the return. The employee told me that if the return code is invalid, they will reprocess it. So I went ahead to cancel the return. The seller denied to reprocess the return and told me I can no longer return this. So, I filed a claim with the Amazon and the Amazon also denied my claim saying that the item is outside the return window. Now I am stuck with a MacBook that doesn't work properly, runs very slow and has a damaged port. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! The 90-day replace, return or refund warranty on Amazon renewed store is just a scam to lure people into buying laptops that are going to stop working in a few months and they DO NOT fulfill their warranty terms either.\",\n",

I don't use it much on battery, but I know if I had to, it would last a few hours of productivity, but probably not long gaming.

Which is real bad, but at the same time it was 600 dollars and 120Hz. Other thing that could be better is that the laptop doesn't have advanced Optimus or even a mux switch so you won't ever get the maximum performance from your graphics card even when it is connected to an external monitor, as the HDMI port and the laptop screen are both connected to the iGPU instead of a MUX switch or directly to de dGPU. The good thing is that you could upgrade it to a 165Hz 300 nits and 100 %srgb, and you could even upgrade the battery so you won't get 4 hours only from a 45 Wh battery, you would be getting around 33% more battery life as the bigger battery is 60Wh\",\n",

      "   'I bought this on eBay for $750, currently $100 less than what\\'s listed here.  For $750 this is a great laptop with most games maxing out the 120Hz capability of the screen on High-Ultra settings, and the speed increase from 60Hz to 120Hz is definitely noticeable.  I bought a second 1TB drive ($100) and 16GB (8GBx2) dual rank DDR4 3200MHz RAM which were both plug-and-play without any installation issues.  Since the 5-stars speaks for itself for the pros, I\\'ll just list the cons here which weren\\'t significant enough for me to reduce the rating:- The ability to add a second M.2 pcie 4.0 SSD is great, but the one I purchased (Samsung 980 1TB) was supposed to have speeds of 3500 MB/s seq reads and 3000 MB/s seq writes, what I\\'m getting instead is 1800 MB/s seq reads and 1500 MB/s seq writes, which just about exactly matches the speed of the 512GB SSD that came with the laptop.  This may be due to a Windows 11 bug restricting the speeds but I\\'m not sure. UPDATE: It was not Windows 11, I fixed this by installing the proper mounting screw to the laptop\\'s motherboard for the SSD to sit correctly.  I\\'m now getting 3600MB/s reads and 2800MB/s writes. BE AWARE the laptop does not come with a spacer or mounting screw for the second M.2 slot. I bought them separately for $7. It\\'s not the standard size screw either, it requires a smaller diameter screw,  luckily the kit I bought came with both size screws and spacer mounts.- The primary M.2 slot where the 512GB SSD sits is a 2242 form factor with no ability to replace it with a 2280 longer form factor.  The secondary M.2 allows you to add in a second pcie 4.0 M.2 SSD, but doing so will take up the space where the 2.5\" SATA SSD/HDD slot is, so you can only have either a second M.2 pcie drive or a 2.5\" SATA drive.',\n",

It has two RAM slots (one empty), as well as two internal SSD slots (one empty) and an HDD slot. They are hidden under a metal shield, so it doesn't appear they are there at first.  I added a 16 gig card for a total of 24 GB RAM, and transferred my 1TB SSD out of my old computer, which takes up the same component space as SSD within the computer, so it's either-or, but you'll definitely want to give yourself at least another TB internal storage.  It runs graphical operations like CAD and 3D printer slicing very quickly as well. The display is sharp and bright.  Audio is pretty loud with stereo speakers at the bottom sides near the front of the laptop, which gives a pretty good surround effect, using the table below to reflect and give the impression of larger speakers.  The main downside is no SD card reader and only two standard USB ports. It does have a USB-C port, but fewer peripherals use that profile.\",\n",

      "  'Reviews': [\"When Asus came out w/this laptop I thought it was innovative and well made. I finally bought this once it went down to a decent price. This ZenBook Duo 14 is beautiful to look at, it's a dark green, all metal device. I don't think everybody NEEDS a dual screened laptop. However, I do find myself taking advantage of the two screens often. I still have quite a few zoom meetings. It's very handy to have zoom on main screen and then notes, email, or other app on smaller screen. Even when just checking email/internet on larger screen, I have spotify on smaller screen. It gives you the versatility to multitask as you see fit. The stylus works well for taking notes, it feels a littler heavier than a pencil, it is battery operated. You can use the stylus on either screen. The laptop came with a stylus, stand and a carrying case. The stand looks flimsy but it is fairly sturdy and elevates the laptop to a good position for daily use. It does make the laptop top heavy so any pressure to that part of the device can make it tip-like if a child or pet is nearby to bother it. The i7 processor seems fast enough to multitask though. I would highly recommend it.\",\n",
      "   \"the moment i saw this laptop i knew i wanted it, and I didn't realize how much of the 2nd screen i would be using, it's really really helping while writing on the main screen and watching some podcast or movie at the bottom. I was thinking of getting a 2600 dollar Alienware laptop vs. this, and there was no second guessing.\",\n",
      "   \"It happens everytime sinxe i bough it. I'm totally upset.\",\n",
      "   \"I didn't think the 2nd screen would be useful, I was wrong. The entire laptop feels well made and has a great weight. The keyboard takes a little getting used to but I adapted with no problems. I love the trackpad being on the side.Haven't had any heating issues even while running memory intensive applications.I would recommend to anyone.\",\n",
      "   'I purchased and loved it, until the screen cracked.  Not sure why. I am very careful with my electronics. Thank God I purchased the insurance.  They are returning my money… Not sure if I am going to replace it with the same model.',\n",
      "   'The added screen is super useful for monitoring another application or for entering data.',\n",
      "   'Extremely happy with this purchase',\n",
      "   'This laptop is great for college since it allows me to open up many tabs at once. I also like the matted screen design which helps prevent fingerprints. The second screen works great and can also be turned off to increase battery life. I enjoy that this listing gives you a case and stylus, very helpful!',\n",
      "   'Bought the laptop in November, took more than a month to deliver. Only used the laptop 3 times and encountered the black screen of death. Absolute rubbish. Thanks for wasting my time and money Asus. If there is a Zero rating I would choose it.',\n",
      "   'The computer was great until it quit working. The screen would not turn back on.',\n",
      "   'Like the laptop but one of the lightning ports is so tight I can’t even plug in the enclosed charging cable. They should’ve tested out the ports before it left the assembly plant. Build quality leaves a lot to be desired!',\n",

      "   '                    The media could not be loaded.                \\xa0So I bought this laptop and it costed 1420$ after tax, so I was expecting a decent quality, but to my unpleasant surprise this was just horrible. The laptop stoped working completely after 2 days of having it and not even 5 hours of use. I talked to Amazon customer service, and they told me to return and order new one. I had no issue with that. I got the new one, and to my unpleasant surprise AGAIN. The new laptop camera is not functioning properly. I never seen such poor quality in a high end laptop. A 400$ laptop will not going to have that may issues.',\n",

      "   \"Got this purely for productivity and NOT for gaming.  This laptop has Intel Iris Xe graphics which isn't made for serious gamers.  Touch screen works great with the finger and included stylus.  I've upgraded the internal drive to a 2TB m.2 which is the largest it can take because it can only fit single-sided m.2 drives.  FYI, 4TB or higher are still currently double-sided m.2.  8GB RAM is good enough for productivity usage.  The case is a fingerprint magnet and it shows up ugly.  So either you have a cloth to wipe it down or do what I do and just stick on a vinyl wrap.  You can get them online and just cut to size.  It's nice to have a microSD card slot on this since I add in a 1TB microSD for data.  Only thing I wish is that it's a deeper slot because the card does stick out a tiny bit for you to push-eject it.  I'm just afraid that it will pop out accidently in the bag or out-and-about.  Mousepad is usable but I always have a bluetooth mouse with me.
